         <h2>But what about the roads?</h2>
         <p>You just don't understand economics,like supply and demand.Don't worry kiddo,where there's a demand there will
            be a supply;we'll all have our roads.

         <h2>Is taxation theft?</h2>
         <p>If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies,demanded that you and your neighbors give me a 
             percentage of your income,in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for,
            would you consider that theft? </p>

         <h2>So,what you're saying is...?</h2>
         <p>Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic
             weapons.
         </p>
         <p>
             A world where voluntaryism and proprty rights are treated with the highest respect.
